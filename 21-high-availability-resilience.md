# 🛡️ High Availability & Resilience

This module explores strategies for building systems that remain operational even under adverse conditions. Think of high availability as an emergency generator—it kicks in when the power goes out, ensuring critical systems stay online. Similarly, resilience ensures your system can recover gracefully from failures.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Master high availability patterns and implementation  
- Learn fault tolerance and circuit breaker patterns  
- Understand disaster recovery strategies  
- Implement resilience patterns and fallback mechanisms

## 🚨 Circuit Breaker Pattern

### Why Use a Circuit Breaker?

The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to a failing service temporarily. This is like flipping a switch to stop electricity flow when a fuse blows—it protects the rest of the system from damage.

**Key Features:**  
- **States:** Closed (normal operation), Open (failure detected), Half-Open (testing recovery).  
- **Thresholds:** Defines how many failures trigger the Open state.  
- **Reset Timeout:** Determines how long to wait before testing recovery.

> **🧠 Analogy:**  
> A circuit breaker is like a traffic light at a busy intersection—it stops cars when there’s an accident to prevent further chaos.

**🤔 Misconception:**  
Circuit breakers are only useful for external services. \
**Reality:** They’re equally valuable for internal components to prevent resource exhaustion.

## 🔄 Retry Pattern

### Exponential Backoff

The retry pattern with exponential backoff retries failed operations with increasing delays. This reduces the load on struggling services and improves the chances of success.

**Key Features:**  
- **Max Retries:** Limits the number of attempts to avoid infinite loops.  
- **Initial Delay:** Sets the base delay before the first retry.  
- **Factor:** Multiplies the delay after each attempt.

> **🧠 Analogy:**  
> Retrying is like knocking on a door—if no one answers, you wait longer before trying again.

> **⚠️ Anti-Pattern:**  
> Using fixed delays for retries can overwhelm the system during peak failures.

## 📦 Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

A robust backup strategy ensures data can be restored in case of failure. This includes regular backups, secure storage, and periodic testing.

**Best Practices:**  
- **Frequency:** Schedule backups based on data criticality.  
- **Retention:** Define how long backups are stored.  
- **Testing:** Regularly test restores to ensure backups are usable.

**🤔 Misconception:**  
Backups are sufficient for disaster recovery. \
**Reality:** Without a clear recovery plan, restoring data can be time-consuming and error-prone.

---

### Recovery Plan

A recovery plan outlines steps to restore operations after a failure. This includes identifying critical systems, assigning responsibilities, and defining communication protocols.

> **🧠 Decision Framework:**  
> Prioritize systems based on their impact on business operations.

> **⚠️ Anti-Pattern:**  
> Failing to document and test recovery plans can lead to confusion and delays during emergencies.

## 🌐 Fault Tolerance & Graceful Degradation

### Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance ensures a system continues operating, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely. For example, a video streaming service might reduce video quality during high traffic instead of going offline.

**Key Techniques:**  
- **Redundancy:** Duplicate critical components to handle failures.  
- **Load Shedding:** Drop non-critical requests to preserve core functionality.  

> **🧠 Analogy:**  
> Fault tolerance is like a ship with watertight compartments—even if one section floods, the ship stays afloat.

---

### Graceful Degradation

Graceful degradation ensures a system provides partial functionality when resources are limited. For instance, an e-commerce site might disable personalized recommendations during peak loads but keep checkout functionality intact.

**🤔 Misconception:**  
Graceful degradation compromises user experience. \
**Reality:** It prioritizes critical features to maintain usability.
