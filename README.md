## 👨‍💻 Meet Your Instructor

Hello! I'm **Ahmad Bilal**, a Senior Full Stack Engineer with over 5 years of hands-on experience. I specialize in architecting and deploying secure, scalable backend systems and cloud infrastructure, with a strong focus on DevOps practices. My passion is helping engineers bridge the gap between theory and real-world application—so you can build systems that are robust, efficient, and ready for scale.

I'm excited to guide you through this course and share the insights, lessons, and best practices I've learned in the field. Let's level up your backend engineering skills together!

## 📚 Course Overview

This course is designed for intermediate to advanced developers who want to master backend engineering. You'll learn everything from fundamental concepts to advanced patterns, with a focus on practical implementation and real-world scenarios.

🎯 **Ultimate Learning Goal**:  
Understand how a client request flows end-to-end:  
`DNS → TLS → HTTP → reverse proxy → API layer → service → DB → infra → response` 

...and design systems that are: \
✅ Scalable  
✅ Secure  
✅ Maintainable  
✅ Observable

## 🧠 Ace Your Interviews with Confidence

Whether you're preparing for system design interviews, backend engineering roles, or infrastructure-focused positions — this course has your back!

It’s designed not just to teach **what** works, but **why**, with:

- 📘 **Conceptual explanations** of core systems  
- ✅ **Do’s and Don’ts** based on real-world engineering  
- ⚖️ **Trade-offs and design choices** explained clearly
